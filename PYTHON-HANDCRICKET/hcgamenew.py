Welcome to Hand Cricket!

Hand Cricket is a fun, casual game where you play 'cricket' with numbers. 
In this computer version, you'll play against the computer, aiming to score more runs than it to win!

Basic Rules of Hand Cricket:

1. Objective:
   The goal is to score more runs than the opponent. 
   There are two roles in the game: batting and bowling.
      - When you're batting, you score runs.
      - When you're bowling, you try to prevent the computer from scoring.

2. The Toss:
   The game starts with a toss to decide who bats first.
      - You'll choose "odd" or "even" and select a number between 0 and 10.
      - The computer will also select a number.
      - If the sum of the two numbers is even, the player who chose "even" wins the toss.
      - If the sum is odd, the player who chose "odd" wins the toss.
      - The toss winner gets to choose whether to bat or bowl first.

3. Batting:
      - When batting, you'll input a number (run) between 0 and 10.
      - The computer will simultaneously choose a "ball" number between 0 and 10.
      - If the numbers don't match, your chosen number is added to your score.
      - If the numbers match, you're "out," and your final score is set.
      
4. Bowling:
      - When bowling, the computer will select a number (run) between 0 and 10.
      - You'll select a "ball" number between 0 and 10.
      - If the numbers don't match, the computer's number is added to its score.
      - If the numbers match, the computer is "out," and its score is set.

5. Winning:
   The player with the higher score at the end wins the match!
   
Let's get started and have fun!
